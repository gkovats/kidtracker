# Kid Tracker

The goal of Kid Tracker is to make a simplistic Web Application for tracking the behavior and chores of children.

* Mark when they've had positive or negative activities, such as completing a tough chore (positive) or receiving a bad grade (negative)
* Tracking a balance of currency, either in dollars, screen time, or "points" of your own creation and personal value.
* Offer a calendar view / timeline of kids activity for a perspective on past behavior
* Give parents quick access for marking good or bad activities, and the ability to "withdraw" or "cash out" any current balances of points, dollars or screen time for kids.

## Inspiration

In searching for simple applications to track the behavior and chores for my kids, too often I'd either found mobile apps that were too complex, had far too busy interfaces, or didn't track the basic things I wanted to watch over time. This app is meant to offer parents a very simple interface for managing rewards for good behavior or accomplishments, as well as marking down any problem behaviors you want to track.
